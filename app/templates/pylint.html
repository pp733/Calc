            <p>
            <ul>
            <li>Object: An object is simply a collection of data (variables) and methods (functions) that act on those data.</li>
            <li>Class: A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.</li>
            <li>Methods: Operations (or actions) that objects perform or operations which are performed to an object.</li>
            <li>Constructor: Code that is executed each time an instance of the class is created.</li>
            <li>Static class: Class that cannot be instantiated, so no objects can be created from the class. The class members are instead accessed using the class name.
                A static class provides a shortcut to the members of the class when instancing is unwarranted.</li>
            <li>Factory Method: It is a creational design pattern which solves the problem of creating product objects
                without specifying their concrete classes.</li>
            <li>Instantiation: The creation of an instance of a class.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Namespace: A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method.</li>
                    <li>Fixture: Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the arrange phase of a test (see Anatomy of a test).</li>
                    <li>Type Hint: Type hinting is a formal solution to statically indicate the type of a value within your Python code.</li>
                    <li>Type Cast: Type casting is a method used to change the variables/ values declared in a certain data type into a different data type to match the operation required to be performed by the code</li>
                    <li>Facade: Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified (but limited) interface to a complex system of classes, library or framework.</li>
                    <li>Property: The property() method in Python provides an interface to instance attributes</li>
