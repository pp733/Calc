            <p>
                The AAA pattern is a pattern for structuring tests.
                It breaks each test down into three parts - Arrange, Act, and Assert - where each part is a step leading to the next.
                The arrange step sets up the testâ€™s input values. The act step prompts the primary function being tested.
                And finally, the assert step verifies that the output of the function is what was expected.
                In other words, each step in the pattern is a function whose return value is the input of the following step.
                <li>For example -
                    assert(act(arrange()));
                </li>

                <p>
                    Arrange inputs and targets and should set up the test case.
                    It is basically the block of code that sets up the conditions for the test action.

                    <li>Few very interesting set of points were stated on automationpanda.com about how a testing engineer should ask a few question before it starts the ARRANGE process.</li>
                    <li>Does the object require any objects or special settings ?</li>
                    <li>Does it need to prep a database ?</li>
                    <li>Does it need to log into a web app ? </li>
                    <li>As you can see in the image on the right side, we are creating a object called calc by instantiating the calc class.</li>
                    <li>This would act as ARRANGE</li>

            <h3 style="background-color:lightsalmon;">ACT</h3>
            <P>
                The primary thing to be tested should be covered by the ACT.
                This could be calling a function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page.
                Keep actions focused on the target behavior.

            <ul>
                <li>As you can see in the image on the right, we have already instantiated the calc class and created the calc object by performing the ARRANGE process.</li>
                <li>Now in order to perform the ACT, we are calling the method that needs to be tested.</li>
                <li>Here we are calling the multiply_numbers() method.</Li>
                <li>This would complete out ACT process.</li>

                <p>
                    This is the last part of the testing, this is where you give the test an expected outcome.
                    Whether the test is made to pass or fail, this is where you give the test an answer that you want to test
                    and see if it passes or fails per your expectations.

                    <li>In ACT, we saw that we are calling the function to get tested.</li>
                    <li>But in ASSERT, we will check/assert that the results are correct.</li>
                    <li>We did that by adding "assert result == 2" in the test code.</li>
