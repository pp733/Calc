            <p>
                Encapsulation is basically wrapping up of data under a single unit.
                Technically, the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only through any member function of its own class in which it is declared.
                They can only call methods which are basically list of public functions.
                Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

            <li>Lets a take a look at the example on the right side.</li>
            <li>As you can see, we made an object called calc.</li>
            <li>Once we made the object, we are now calling a method called multiply_numbers() inside the Calculator class.</li>
            <li>And then finally, we are providing some values to the multiplication method to check if its right or wrong.</li>
            <li>Here we are wrapping the data to do the multiplication into one single unit and can only be accessed by the member function test_calcultor_multiply().</li>

                <p>
                    It can be defined as a task that can perform a single action in different ways.
                    It occurs when there is inheritance.
                    Inheritance lets one class acquire the properties and attributes of another class. And so, polymorphism allows us to use these inherited properties to perform different tasks. Thus, allowing us to achieve the same action in many different ways.
                    In Python, Polymorphism lets us define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.

                <li>The parent class (calculations) has it's own methods that we created during the development of the program.</li>
                <li>Now, we are calling each of those methods that we created in parent class in the child class with some iterations making a perfect example of polymorphism.</li>

                <p>
                    It is the mechanism in python by which one class is allowed to inherit the features (fields and methods) of another class.
                    It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class.
                    The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits is called the base (or parent) class.
                    Main advantage of inheritance is that it reduces code repetition.
                    You can place all the standard methods and attributes in the parent class. These are accessible by the child class derived from it.
                    By dividing the code into multiple classes, the applications look better and the error identification is easy.

                    <Li>As you can see on the very top of the picture, we are using and importing the addition class.</Li>
                    <li>We are basically importing all the properties or attributes that the addition class is using into the child class.</li>
                    <Li>This clearly shows the inheritance mechanism being used as one class is allowed to inherit the features of another class (Parent class).</Li>

            <P>
                Abstraction is to hide the overcomplication from the user.
                The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. In Python, an abstraction is used to hide the irrelevant data/class in order to reduce the complexity. It also enhances the application efficiency.
                Abstraction is basically the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details.
                In Python, abstraction can be achieved by using abstract classes and interfaces.

                <li>Lets take a look at the example on the right side of the page.</li>
                <li>First of all, we are importing the abstract class "Calculator" on very top.</li>
                <li>Next thing is that we don't have any idea what are the functions of the abstract class since its not visible and irrelevant
                    but we can create a new obj called calc to perform tests by invoking the subtract_number() method.</li>
                <li>We know how to call the methods in the abstract class, but we have no idea what they perform as it is an irrelevant information for us.</li>
